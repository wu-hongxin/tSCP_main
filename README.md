We provide a simple example and associated code.
Datasets: Stanford Drone dataset
Object detection algorithm: YOLOv5. You can train the network according to the corresponding scenario.
To test different scenarios, the ELC and obstacle in mymain.c need to be modified. These two contents represent the structural information of the scene, such as the scope of the scene and the size of obstacles.
If you want to change the number of cameras, change c = sum(x)-b; in AnsConstrains. b indicates the number of cameras
Due to my busy schedule near graduation, I can only update the above content for the time being. The rest of the content can't be updated until I graduate
